Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for
foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his
science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the
Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the
Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a
second Empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening
years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most
intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled
Encyclopedia Galactica. The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble
whomever he needs, provided he and the "Encyclopedists" be exiled to a remote
planet, Terminus. Seldon agrees to set up his own collection of Encyclopedists,
and also secretly implements a contingency plan-a second Foundation-at the
"opposite end" of the galaxy.
